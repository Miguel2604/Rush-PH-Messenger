# Rush PH Messenger Bot

A Facebook Messenger bot that provides real-time train arrival times and ETAs for Philippine train systems (MRT, LRT-1, LRT-2) by scraping data from rush-ph.com.

## Problem Statement

In the Philippines, data connectivity can be limited when commuting, but Facebook Messenger is accessible through free data plans. This bot solves the problem by allowing users to get train schedule information through Messenger without needing to access the web directly.

## Features

- üöÜ Real-time train arrival times
- üìç Station-to-station journey planning
- ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated travel time calculations
- üí¨ Conversational interface via Facebook Messenger
- üîÑ Supports MRT-3, LRT-1, and LRT-2 lines

## How It Works

1. User sends a message to the bot
2. Bot asks for current station
3. User provides current station
4. Bot asks for destination station
5. Bot scrapes rush-ph.com and provides:
   - Next train arrival times
   - Estimated journey duration
   - Line information
